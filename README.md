As I progress through the JavaScript course provided by [SuperSimple.dev](https://github.com/supersimpledev), I am solving each exercise to better understand core JavaScript concepts such as functions, loops, arrays, and DOM manipulation. This repository serves as a record of my learning journey.

## Exercises

You can find my solutions in the `1-exercise-solutions` folder. Each exercise is named after the topic it covers:

- Basic JavaScript concepts
- Functions and scope
- Arrays and loops
- Objects and methods
- DOM manipulation

Feel free to browse through the files to see how I've approached each problem.
