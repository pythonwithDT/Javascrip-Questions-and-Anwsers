Great question! Let’s break down why we use `try` and `catch` in addition to `if` and `else`:

### What `try` and `catch` Do

- **`try` Block**: This part of the code is where you attempt to do something that might fail. For instance, in our calculator, it’s where we try to evaluate the math expression.
- **`catch` Block**: If something goes wrong inside the `try` block, the code in the `catch` block is executed. This is where you handle any errors that occurred.

### Why Use `try` and `catch`?

1. **Error Handling**:
   - When evaluating a math expression with `eval`, there's a chance that the input might be incorrect or could cause an error (like `1 / 0` or `1 + `).
   - `try` and `catch` allow the program to handle these errors gracefully. If you don’t use them, your program might crash or stop working when it encounters an error.

2. **Prevent Crashes**:
   - Without `try` and `catch`, if something goes wrong during evaluation, the whole script could break or stop running. The `catch` block helps prevent this by catching the error and allowing you to handle it in a controlled way.

3. **User Experience**:
   - Using `try` and `catch`, you can show a user-friendly message like `'Error'` if something goes wrong, instead of leaving the user confused or seeing a blank screen.

### Comparison with `if` and `else`

`if` and `else` are used for making decisions based on conditions. For example:
```javascript
if (buttonValue === '=') {
    // Handle calculation
} else {
    // Handle other button presses
}
```
- This part of the code checks whether the user pressed the "=" button and decides what to do based on that.

### Why They Work Together

- **`if` and `else`** decide what kind of action to take based on the button pressed.
- **`try` and `catch`** handle any potential problems that might occur while performing those actions.

Here’s a simplified analogy:

- Imagine you’re baking a cake. `if` and `else` are like deciding whether to use chocolate or vanilla based on what you want to bake.
- `try` and `catch` are like having a backup plan in case the oven breaks down or you run out of flour. If something goes wrong, you handle the situation without stopping everything.

### Example Without `try` and `catch`

If you didn’t use `try` and `catch`, and an error occurred, your calculator might break. Here’s what could happen:

```javascript
if (buttonValue === '=') {
    calculation = eval(calculation); // Risky: might fail and break the script
    console.log(calculation);
} else {
    calculation += buttonValue;
}
```

If `eval(calculation)` fails (e.g., due to a syntax error), your script might not handle it properly, leading to a crash.

### Summary

- **`try` and `catch`**: Used to handle errors and avoid crashing when something goes wrong.
- **`if` and `else`**: Used to decide what actions to take based on conditions.

Combining them ensures that your code runs smoothly even if unexpected problems occur during execution.
