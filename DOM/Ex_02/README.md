**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Create a Second Button in HTML:**
   - First, in your HTML file, you need to create a second button element, similar to the first one:
   ``html
   <button class="js-but">Hello</button>
   ``
   - This button will appear on your webpage with the text "Hello" inside it, just like the first one.
   - The difference here is that this button has a class attribute set to `"js-but"`, which makes it easy to target this specific button with JavaScript.

2. **Select the Button Using JavaScript:**
   - The line `const buttonElement = document.querySelector('.js-but')` selects the second button using its class name.
   - `document.querySelector('.js-but')` searches the HTML document for the first element with the class `js-but` and returns it.
   - The selected button is then stored in a variable called `buttonElement`.

3. **Change the Button's Text:**
   - The `.innerText = 'Welcome!'` part of the code changes the text inside the selected button.
   - `innerText` is a property that represents the text inside an HTML element. By setting it to `'Welcome!'`, the button's text is updated from "Hello" to "Welcome!".

4. **Display the Updated Button in the Console:**
   - The line `console.log(buttonElement);` prints the updated button element to the console.
   - This allows you to see the button element with its new text in your browser's developer tools console.

**Result:**
When you run this code in a browser, the second button's text will change from "Hello" to "Welcome!" and the updated button will be displayed in the console.
